# Website Scraper

## Overview
This Website Scraper is a Java-based application that allows users to extract data from websites using CSS selectors. It provides a simple command-line interface for scraping web content and performing basic analysis on the scraped data.

## Features
- Web scraping using user-specified CSS selectors
- Multiple selector support for diverse data extraction
- Basic word count analysis on scraped content
- Interactive command-line interface
- Flexible and extensible architecture

## Components

### 1. WebsiteScraper.java
The main class that provides the user interface and orchestrates the scraping and analysis processes.

### 2. ScraperResult.java
A data class that encapsulates the results of a scraping operation, including the URL and the extracted data.

### 3. ScraperUtil.java
Utility class containing methods for web scraping using JSoup.

### 4. AnalysisUtil.java
Utility class with methods for analyzing scraped data, such as word count.

## Dependencies

### JSoup
JSoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML. It provides a very convenient API for extracting and manipulating data, using the best of DOM, CSS, and jquery-like methods.

#### Why JSoup?
- Easy-to-use API for parsing HTML
- Supports CSS selectors for finding and extracting data
- Scrapes and parses HTML from a URL, file, or string
- Manipulates HTML elements, attributes, and text
- Implements the WHATWG HTML5 specification
- Robust in handling malformed HTML

### Log4j2
Apache Log4j2 is a popular logging framework for Java applications. It's used in this project to provide informative logging during the scraping process.

#### Why Log4j2?
- High performance
- Automatic reloading of configurations
- Advanced filtering options
- Support for multiple APIs (SLF4J, Commons Logging, etc.)
- Asynchronous loggers for low-latency systems

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have Java 8 or higher and Maven installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run `mvn clean install` to build the project.
4. Run the `WebsiteScraper` class to start the application.
5. Follow the on-screen menu to:
   - Scrape a website by entering a URL and CSS selectors
   - Analyze scraped data using word count
   - Exit the program

## Example Usage

1. Scraping a website:
   - Choose option 1 from the menu
   - Enter the URL (e.g., "https://example.com")
   - Enter CSS selectors (e.g., "h1", "p.content", "div.article")
   - View the scraped content

2. Analyzing scraped data:
   - Choose option 2 from the menu
   - Enter the selector to analyze (e.g., "p.content")
   - View the word count analysis

## Future Enhancements
1. Implement multithreading for parallel scraping:
   - Use Java's concurrent package (java.util.concurrent) to improve performance when scraping multiple pages or websites simultaneously.
   - This will significantly boost the efficiency of large-scale scraping tasks.

2. Add robust error handling and retry mechanisms:
   - Implement comprehensive exception handling throughout the application.
   - Create a retry mechanism using a library like Guava Retrying for handling temporary network issues or rate limiting.

3. Implement data persistence:
   - Use Spring Data JPA with Hibernate to store scraped data in a relational database.
   - This will allow for better data management, querying, and scalability.

4. Create a RESTful API:
   - Use Spring Boot to develop a web service layer, enabling the scraper to be accessed via HTTP requests.
   - This will make your scraper more versatile and easier to integrate with other systems.

5. Enhance logging and monitoring:
   - Implement more detailed logging using SLF4J facades.
   - Add health checks and metrics using Spring Boot Actuator.
   - This will greatly improve the maintainability and observability of your application in a production environment.

6. Implement comprehensive testing:
   - Add unit tests using JUnit 5 and Mockito.
   - Create integration tests to ensure all components work together correctly.
   - Implement performance tests to measure and optimize scraping efficiency.

## Notes
- Always respect websites' terms of service and robots.txt files when scraping.
- This tool is for educational purposes. Ensure you have permission to scrape any website you target.
- The current version stores scraping results in memory. For large datasets, consider implementing a database solution.
